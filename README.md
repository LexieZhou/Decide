# WebDecide
WebDecide: an interactive web interface that visualizes a weighted knowledge graph containing 2,376 version knowledge extracted from Stack Overflow discussions.

## Summary
Version incompatibility issues are prevalent when reusing or reproducing deep learning (DL) models and applications. While official documents such as PyPI are neither comprehensive nor up-to-date, Stack Overflow (SO) discussions possess a wealth of version knowledge that has not been explored by previous approaches. To bridge this gap, we present WebDecide, a web-based visualization of a weighted knowledge graph that contains 2,376 version knowledge extracted from SO discussions. As an interactive tool, WebDecide allows the users to easily check whether two libraries are compatible or not, search for a third-party DL component with a specific version, explore a DL component without any version constraint, and shows relevant SO posts as references.
